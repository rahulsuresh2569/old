This course provided a great foundation in JavaScript, covering everything from the absolute basics to more advanced topics. I found it very easy to understand and learn from. The hands-on exercises were instrumental in solidifying my understanding of the concepts.

## What's Inside?

Here you'll find a collection of files and small projects, each corresponding to a topic covered in the course. This repository is a testament to my learning arc, showing my progress from writing my first line of JavaScript to building interactive web elements.

After completing this course, I took on a bigger challenge to apply my new-found skills. I recreated a functional Amazon e-commerce website clone from scratch!
